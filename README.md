## How to set up & run application

 For guidance please refer to the file ref: '2.2.setup_instructions_to_run_application' 
 
1. Git clone repository,
2. Install PHP, mySQL, Composer, and GNU's Make software.  
2. Set up a local  mySQL database named `quiz-manager` (details below) 
3. Compile CSS UI resources by running `npm install`, and build dev assets running `npm run dev` ,
4. Run the command `make migrate-seed` to run database migrations and seeders,
5. Run `make start` to start the server. View application on your localhost.

See `Makefile` for a list of commands available in the application. 


#### Create a local mySQL database

1. Install the  mySQL client,

2. Run the mySQL client - `$ mysql -u root -p`
    - `root` - user
    - `p` - you will be prompted to enter a password. Please press enter, with a blank password.

3. Create a local database the application can integrate with: `CREATE DATABASE quiz_manager;` 
    - Run the query `SHOW DATABASES;`, to confirm your database has been created.

4. In the Quiz Manager `.env` file (line 9-15), please check the Database Connection  config matches the details you configured locally. 
    - `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` - you should not have to update these
    - `DB_DATABASE` - update with the name of your Database (e.g. `quiz_manager`)
    - `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` - represent your personal mySQL user credentials 

5. Once your `.env` config is set up, run `make migrate` to confirm your Database connection is working as expected.
